# VideoMeet - Flutter Video Call App

A complete, production-ready video calling application built with Flutter and Agora. This project demonstrates real-time video calls, user authentication, a browsable user list, and a modern Picture-in-Picture call UI.

The app is built using a clean architecture (Repository Pattern) and manages state with `Provider` and `get_it`.
