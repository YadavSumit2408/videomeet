# VideoMeet - Flutter Video Call App

A complete, production-ready video calling application built with Flutter and Agora. This project demonstrates real-time video calls, user authentication, a browsable user list, and a modern Picture-in-Picture call UI.

The app is built using a clean architecture (Repository Pattern) and manages state with `Provider` and `get_it`.


| Login | Home Screen | User List | Video Call (PiP) |




##  Features

* **User Authentication:** Full login flow using a real API (`reqres.in`).
* **Persistent Session:** Auth token is saved locally using `shared_preferences`.
* **Bottom Navigation:** Clean navigation between a Home screen and a User List screen.
* **Real-time Video:** 1-on-1 video calls powered by the Agora SDK.

* **Full Call Controls:**
    * Mute / Unmute Microphone
    * Turn Video On / Off

    * End Call
* **Screen Sharing:** (Android only at the moment).
